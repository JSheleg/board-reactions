# Board Reactions ![Github licence](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Project Description

A fullstack MERN application that creates an interactive social networking site that connects board game enthusiast to new games and new people.

## Elevator Pitch

The quarantine enacted by COVID caused us to lose connection with many of our social groups making it difficult to get together and play games.
Many of our friends may have moved or decided to stay in a self quarantine with the pandemic still in full swing. As a result, they find themselves
without anyone to play or discuss one of their favorite hobbies, board games! We created a social platform that will allow this individual to connect
with other board game enthusiasts on games they both enjoy or discover new games together. They will be able to find, follow, and chat with like minded individuals 
in the board game community to create life long connections!
